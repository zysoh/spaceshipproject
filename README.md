# Spaceship Classification Project
The objective of this project is to make predictions as to whether members of a spaceship were teleported into another dimension. My workflow can be seperated into the following sections:

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Investigate basic dataset information, distribution, missing values, data types etc.
- Investigate Correlation between different variables
## Feature Engineering
- Split Cabin into 3 different variables 
- Encoding categorical variables into numerical form
- One Hot encoding for categorical variables with many entries
- Imputed columns with missing values
## Model Learning and Prediction
- Used a Random Forest Classifier
- Generate Prediction for test set (for Kaggle)
